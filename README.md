# Additional Notes:

I forked this from [Bjarno's GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/Bjarno/playtimer-fabric) and updated it to 1.19, then
decided to try to add config which took a long time due to my limited knowledge of Fabric modding.

However, **I will be supporting
this mod in future versions of Minecraft and Fabric** as I use it in my own playthroughs. 

I also can attempt to fix and bugs and add any features. **If you would like to request a feature or report a bug please
check the [issues page](https://github.com/yellowyears/playtimer-fabric/issues)**. I will get back to you as soon as possible!

Please feel free to fork the project and make a pull request. **This may take me a long time to approve as I need to
check whether it works, whether it is optimised and whether it is safe :)**
