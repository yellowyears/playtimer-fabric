# Playtimer

Quick 'n Dirty Fabric mod to show a "how long have I been playing" timer in the bottom-right corner. Inspired by Grian/Scar/Joel's Hardcore series.

No configuration necessary.

This mod is built for the Fabric loader. Fabric API is not required.

## How does this mod work?

This mod keeps track of how long you have played on a certain world (or server). The first time you join a world/server with this mod enabled, the server statistics will be queried to get the playtime before you enabled this mod.

## How to install
